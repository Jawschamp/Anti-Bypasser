# Anti-Bypasser
I'm sure your question is wtf is Anti-Bypasser well, Anti-Bypasser is a Hack tool being created in Python using "ctypes" because if you don't code in C++ this is the next step. This will be able to inject files through most GeForce Now, and some Google Statida that will be able to read memory coming from those serveces by injecting a file that the server can't refuse ik poeple are gonna say wtf does that mean, you will once this is done.
